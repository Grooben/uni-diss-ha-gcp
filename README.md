# Design, implementation, and evaluation of a virtual-machine based, high-availability (HA) MySQL Master-Master replication service
## Abstract
High availability (HA) storage services are now commonplace as part of cloud providers’ PaaS offerings. Examples are Amazon’s Aurora and Azure MSSQL/MySQL PaaS services where data storage is fully managed in terms of redundancy, scalability and load balancing. Though the benefits of a PaaS-based HA storage service are clear, there are scenarios where the need for a more portable and user-configurable solution is required where interoperability is key. A comprehensive review of cloud patterns/models including PaaS and IaaS, as well as HA services will be undertaken including review of internal and external cloud load balancing techniques. By building a bespoke and highly interoperable HA storage service using an IaaS approach, the service will have the capability to be deployed across a minimum of two Linux virtual machines with master-slave, master-master, and eventually load balancing configured if deployed to cloud. The virtual machines will host the entire deployment stack, emulating the feature set of a PaaS HA storage service. The result is bespoke virtual machine images running the HA service which can be deployed on any cloud provider’s platform. A basic REST service will be required to test the replication service’s performance capabilities. This project is multi-faceted with some components that can be negotiated from the perspective of local and/or cloud development. Development in the first instance will take place on locally-managed virtual machines using hosted virtualization, with a view to some cloud-based deployment for testing.
